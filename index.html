Academic activities of IIIT-Surat were started in July 2017 in the campus of SVNIT, Surat.

The campus development with hostel and additional academic facilities will commence at the earliest. The Institute has started the PhD programme during 2022-23. My earnest desire is to develop IIIT-Surat as a pioneering academic Institute in the country with the patronage of the Ministry of Education, Govt. of India.
